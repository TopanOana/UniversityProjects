hill climbing method: 
	find optimal solution by ITERATIVELY improving the current solution
	- local search alg.-> only considers solutions that are in the neighbourhood of the
		current solution


steps:
	1. start with initial state (candidate to the solution of the problem)
	2. evaluate current state to determine quality | fitness?
	3. generate set of neighbouring states by making small modifications 
		to the current one
	4. evaluate the fitness of each neighbouring state
	5. select the best neighbouring state and make it the current one
	6. repeat steps 3-5 until no improvement can be made
		or a predefined stopping criterion is met

advantages: 
	- simplicity
	- ease of implementation

meshgrid -> returns coordinate matrices from coordinate vectors
