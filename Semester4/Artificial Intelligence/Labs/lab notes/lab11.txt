Steady state genetic algorithm:
	maintain a fixed size population and repeatedly replace a subset of individuals
	with newly generated offspring. 
	- focuses on the evolution of a few individuals at a time
  steps:
	1. initialization (create the population)
	2. evaluation (check the fitness of each individual in the population- optimization problem)
	3. selection (selecting two parents from the population based on fitness)
	4. crossover (perform recombination on selected parents to create offspring individuals)
	5. mutation (apply mutation to the offspring to introduce random changes ~ smol)
	6. replacement (replace a subset of individuals with the new offspring)
	7. termination (repeat steps 2-6 until a condition is met)



Generational genetic algorithm:
	create a completely new fixed size population at each generation
  steps:
	1. initialization (create the population)
	2. evaluation (check the fitness of each individual in the population - optimization problem)
	3. selection (selecting two parents from the population based on fitness to serve next generation)
	4. crossover (perform recombination on selected parents to create offspring individuals)
	5. mutation (apply mutation to the offspring to introduce random changes ~ smol)
	6. replacement (replace current population with the new offspring)
	7. termination (repeat steps 2-6 until a condition is met)
