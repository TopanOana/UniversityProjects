Code Review Naomi Tranca: 

->in Lexic.txt
	line 17
	you shouldn't have | between letter and {letter|digit}
		since letter | {letter|digit} is not the same as letter {letter | digit} 
		in the first case you can get the empty string

-> in tokens.in or lexic.txt 
	these assignment operators aren't referenced in the syntax file 
	+=, -=, *= etc so they should be taken out 
	
-> tokens.in
	the keyword 'character' is written but it isn't used in the syntax file
	so it should be taken out

-> in syntax.in 
	when declaring an array, you should not be able to declare an array with
	the number between the [] negative.
	that should be changed

-> in the syntax file
	when there is only one statement in the statement-list, there won't be a
	semicolon at the end and that should be changed for consistency
